Some Design Patterns with it's implementation in java

## Catalog
 * ### Behavioral Patterns
    * #### Command 
        turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. 
        This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations.
    * #### Observer 
        define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.
 
 * ### Creational Pattern
    * #### Factory 
        provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
 
 
 * ### Structural Patterns
    * #### Facade 
        provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
