# Design-Patterns
Some Design Patterns with it's implementation in java

## Catalog
 * ### Behavioral Patterns
    * #### Command 
        turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. 
        This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations.
    * #### Observer 
        define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.
 
 * ### Creational Pattern
    * #### Factory 
        provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
 
 
 * ### Structural Patterns
    * #### Facade 
        provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
    * #### Adapter 
        allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
    * #### Composite 
        lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
    * #### Bridge 
        lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies
        —abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other..
